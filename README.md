# Python GUI Calculator
**This is a simple GUI-based calculator implemented in Python using a graphical user interface (GUI) library. The calculator provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations with ease. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more complex calculations.**
# Technologies  Used
* **Python Programming Language:** The entire calculator application is written in Python. Python is used for handling the logic, calculations, and event handling for the GUI.
* **Tkinter (Python Standard Library):** Tkinter is the primary technology used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) for the calculator. 
* **Tkinter Widgets:** Tkinter offers various GUI elements, known as widgets, which are used to build the calculator's interface. In this project, the following widgets are used: 

  * **Tk:** The main application window created using the Tk() class. 
  * **Entry:** An input field widget used to display and take input from the user. 
  * **Button:** Buttons for digits (0-9), arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), the equal sign (=), decimal point (.), and the clear button.
  * **Event-Driven Programming:** The calculator is event-driven, meaning it responds to user actions, such as button clicks, by executing specific functions.
  * **Arithmetic Operations and Evaluation:** The calculator's core functionality includes basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The eval() function is used to evaluate the expression and perform the calculations.
  * **Lambda Functions:** Lambda functions are used to associate specific functions with button clicks as their command attribute in a concise manner.
